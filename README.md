CDNWS-examples
==============

Example usage for the Highwinds CDN web services. To get started, log into StrikeTracker,
click "Edit Profile" from the user menu, click on "User Access", and create an API token
with which you can authenticate with the API. All of the examples in this project expect 
the STRIKETRACKER_TOKEN environment variable to be set to your access token.
